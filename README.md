# CRUD Redux

Hi! I´m an Small CRUD made as a demo for Redux, made with ReactJS, Javascript, JSON Fake Server and Bootstrap!
You can use me as a reference for a simple app for REDUX for and interview, o for anything you need.

It´s a very basic app, here you can add, edit, view and delete products. If you have an app small like this one in production, i would recommend using ContextAPI instead of Redux for state management. Remember, this is just a Demo.

Feel free to fork me :)

## How to Start

* Install dependencies `npm i`
* Install `json-server` globally `npm i -g json-server`
* Run client `npm start`
* Run fake Services (see the JSON-Fake API section)

All done! :) 

### JSON-Fake API

To start this fake server we have to run `json-server db.json --port 4000` we need to change the port in case our client it´s already running in post 3000 by default
